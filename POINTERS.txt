A ponter is a variable which contains a memory address
Every time you declare a variable, a computer will reserve a memory for this variable

char -> 1 byte
int -> 4 bytes
float -> 4 bytes

To determine the size of those types on your computer, you can use the sizeof operator.

C - Strings

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'

char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'}; which is equivalent to:
char greeting[] = "Hello";

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        char greeting[6]={'H','E','L','L','O','\0' };
        printf("Greetig message: %s\n",greeting);
        return(0);
    }
